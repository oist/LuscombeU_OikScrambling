# OikScrambling

This package contains a collection of vignettes to perform the analysis of
pairwise genome alignments between _Oikopleura_ genomes.

The vignettes in the _Supplemental Material_ section of the header menu are
related to our preprint “[Extreme genome scrambling in cryptic _Oikopleura dioica_
species](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.09.539028v1)”.

The core functions used here are maintained in our _GenomicBreaks_ R package,
which is fully documented at: <https://oist.github.io/GenomicBreaks>.

See the “Get Started“ vignette for details on how to run the computations.
